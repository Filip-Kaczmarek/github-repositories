# github-repositories
This is a web app which allows to search for a github account by username and then displays user's repositories sorted by number of stars.

<h2>User guide</h2>
1. Download this repository<br>
2. Make sure you have python 3 installed (python 3.9 recommended)<br>
3. Install all libraries: flask, requests, bs4, wtforms (e.g. on windows open cmd and type 'pip install flask' etc.)<br>
4. Open the downloaded project in your favourite Python IDE or access the project folder from terminal.<br>
5. Run the project with IDE or type 'python app.py' in terminal.<br>
6. The project will run on your localhost. Now you can search for a github user!<br><br>

This is a simple version of an app with no extraordinary styling. It also doesn't handle input errors yet, the user must input the precise name of a searched account.
